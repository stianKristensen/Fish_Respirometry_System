Drive shaft sealing rings provide a very compact and simple solution to sealing rotating shafts. Their use is excellent for low to medium pressure applications such as for model submarines.
The shaft sealing ring, also known under the trade name SimmerringÂ®, features a narrow sealing lip pressed on to a shaft by a small coil spring. The spring pressure is adequate to form an effective seal without causing excessive amounts of friction.

The section housing the coil spring (look closely) is the rear of the sealing ring which shoud face towards the prop. The more flat face section is the front of the sealing ring and should be installed facing the inside of the WTC.

Make sure to grease the sealing ring from time to time in order to prevent excessive wearout.
Furthermore, sealing rings should only be used in combination with drive shafts made of stainless steel. Shafts made of brass will wear quite fast around the section of the sealing ring lip.
